### Things to Note About This Project As of Now:

1.  PRs are welcomed if PR rules are followed.
2.  Collaboration will bring more features and ultimately make this more useful for everyone involved!
3. `dev.js` is a *required* file for this app to run.
    - if there is a want to contribute and run locally, submit an issue to the repo and assign to the owner.
    - access will be determined and owner will reach out individually to address if needed.

### PR RULES

1. Any PR made MUST be approved by repo owner
2. Preferrably, if PR is made, it will have been versioned correctly.
    - If not, repo owner will git pull, version and push.
    - 'standard-version' node module IS part of the package.json, scripts are in there accordingly.
    - Run 'npm run release' to version if not done already.

3. Ensure `git pull` has been done to prevent any merge conflicts.
    - Always rebase! :D

4. PR content must be developed to its own branch. On approval, branch will be merged into master.

### TODOS

- [ ] Write up server/client test cases.
    > Pass comes from express.js route tests and linting upon build.
    Migrating to circleCI 2.0 and schoolwork have become more of a 
    priority as far as personal stuff goes.

## SESSION STORAGE IS ACTIVE BY COOKIE AND STORED SECURELY IN MONGODB.
